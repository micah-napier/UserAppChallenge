# User List App

## Overview

This task is intentionally small and designed to take **60 – 75 minutes**. It will be assessed as a commercial grade application. You will fix and extend a tiny SwiftUI feature that interacts with a real public API.

## UserList App

The user list app is a small app that:

- Renders a list of users
- Fetches data from the public API:
    **https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users**
- Shows loading, success, and error states
- Contains bugs

## Your Tasks

### 1. Fix the Existing Bugs

- The list should display user data
- Loading and error states behave properly

### 2. Implement the Refresh feature

The refresh button should:

- Trigger a reload of the data
- Show a loading state during refresh

### 3. Add Unit Tests

We want to see your approach towards testing this functionality.

### 4. Add a Short README

Please include a short **5 – 10 line** explanation covering:

- The main bugs you identified
- How you fixed them
- Any design decisions or trade-offs you made

## Submission

Please submit a link to a repository containing your solution. We will clone the repository and run tests to ensure your solution is correct. In the interview, we discuss your changes.

## Time Expectation

This challenge is intentionally scoped to **60 – 75 minutes**.

**NOTE: Please do not Reference the interviewing company in code.**
